# SnipSnap

A simple but powerful tool to make your screenshots prettier.

## Motivation

I built SnipSnap because I wasn't happy with the other options as they were either in the browser or needed to be used as your primary screenshot tool. I use [Cleanshot](https://cleanshot.com/) and SnipSnap fits into that workflow perfectly.

I've also always wanted to build a desktop app and this idea kinda let me do that while trying a few new technologies which I hadn't done in a while.

## Technologies

- [Tauri](https://tauri.app/)
- [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/)

## Notes

- I've personally only tested the application on MacOS. I think everything should work fine on both Linux and Windows? It'd be great if someone could test it out and let me know!
